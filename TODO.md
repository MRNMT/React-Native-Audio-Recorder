# TODO: Add Fast Forward and Enhanced Seeking Features

## Steps to Complete

- [x] Add `onRewind` and `onFastForward` functions in App.js (seek backward/forward by 10 seconds)
- [x] Pass `onRewind` and `onFastForward` as props to VoiceNoteItem
- [x] Add rewind (<<) and fast forward (>>) buttons in VoiceNoteItem.js, visible when playing
- [x] Add current time display (e.g., "0:30 / 1:20") in VoiceNoteItem.js
- [x] Ensure progress bar allows finger/cursor seeking (already implemented, verify)
- [x] Test rewind/fast forward buttons and seeking functionality
